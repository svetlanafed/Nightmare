He holds the gun against my head
I close my eyes and bang I am dead
I know he knows
That he is killing me for mercy
And here I go
He holds my body in his arms
He didn't mean to do no harm
And he holds me tight
Oh, he did it all to spare me
From the awful things in life that come
And he cries and cries
I know he knows
